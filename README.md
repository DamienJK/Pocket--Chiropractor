# Pocket--Chiropractor

This app was devoloped in two days by <a src = "https://davidkozdra.github.io/">David Kozdra </a> and DamienJK. 

The purpose of this app is to discourage bad posture while on an android cell phone. By using the sensor systems in Android, as well as the notification system the user can save a y-position that is exeptible and if the phone goes below that value the notification system triggers reminding the user of good posture habits. The value will save after closing the app.
